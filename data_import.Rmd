```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Read in some data

Read in the litters dataset. 

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("./data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)

```
## Take a look at the data

Printing in the console. 
```{r}
litters_df
```

## I like the skimr function because it can tell you if there are missing values for a given variable (look at the 4*8)
Here a value for gd0_weight was not entered for 15 litter samples. The histogram also can tell you if there's a bimodal distrbution of data. 
```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```
## Options to read_csv
 
If you want to learn more about the file without perusing it, type in the console `?read_csv()` for more information.
